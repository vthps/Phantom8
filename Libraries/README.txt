README.txt for Electronics_Integration/Libraries

Unzip the folder for the library(ies) that you want into C:\Users\(username)\Documents\Arduino\libraries

Make sure that when you double click the unzipped folder, you can see the .cpp and .c and .h files. If they are nested in a folder, the Arduino ide WILL NOT find them.
